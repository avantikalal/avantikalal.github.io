# About

I am a researcher working at the cross-section of machine learning and genomics. The goal of my research is to use deep learning models to identify biologically meaningful patterns in the human genome, reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases, and develop new therapeutics. 

Currently, I work as a Principal AI Scientist at Genentech (Roche). Previously, I was a Senior Data Scientist at Insitro, Senior Scientist in Deep Learning and Genomics at NVIDIA Research, and a postdoctoral researcher in the Departments of Genetics and Pathology at Stanford University.
