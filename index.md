I am a computational biologist with an interest in the application of machine learning and deep learning to genomic data. Currently, I work as a Senior Genomic Data Scientist at [Insitro](https://insitro.com).

Previously, I was a Senior Scientist in Deep Learning and Genomics at NVIDIA, and a postdoctoral researcher in the Departments of Genetics and Pathology at Stanford University.

My areas of expertise include functional genomics, next-generation sequencing, cancer genomics, machine learning and deep learning.
