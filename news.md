### Upcoming

* **May 2026** – I am honored to be a speaker at **[SynBioBeta 2026: The Era of Programmable Biology](https://www.syntheticbiologysummit.com/2026-speakers/avantika-lal)** in San Jose. I will be discussing the intersection of DNA foundation models and the next generation of synthetic biology.

### Recent

* **November 2025** – Visited Stanford University for the **scverse conference** to share insights on Decima with the single-cell community, specifically highlighting its applications in modeling diverse cellular and disease states.
* **October 2025** – I traveled to Boston for **ASHG 2025**, where I delivered a talk on Decima, focusing on how our foundation model identifies the sequence determinants of gene expression at cell-type specific resolution.
* **May 2025** – I had the pleasure of returning to the **Biology of Genomes** meeting at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) to give a talk on our progress in decoding the regulatory grammar of the human genome using Decima.
* **January 2025** – I gave an invited talk at the **Society for Lab Automation and Screening (SLAS) 2025** in San Diego, titled *"AI-Guided Design of Nucleic Acids for Therapeutic Applications,"* where I discussed the shift toward generative design in DNA/RNA therapeutics.

### Featured Media

* **Nature Feature** – I was interviewed by *Nature* for the feature article **"[Beyond AlphaFold: how AI is decoding the grammar of the genome](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02621-8)"**, where I discussed our work on **regLM**, a genomic language model designed to engineer regulatory DNA sequences with specific functions.

* **Podcast Feature** – I joined Kashef Qaadri on the **[biorad.io podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-15-optimizing-drug-target-identification-through/id1482819808?i=1000582312782)** for an in-depth conversation on how AI is optimizing drug target identification and the future of AI in drug discovery.
